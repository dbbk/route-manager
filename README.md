# Sample React Components Library
Use this repo as the base for a new Festicket component library using React.

## Setup
First, you'll want to clone this repo into a new project. For our examples we'll be calling the new library `my-awesome-lib`, you should replace this with your own name.
```
git clone https://github.com/festicket/sample-react-components-library my-awesome-lib
cd my-awesome-lib
rm -rf .git
git init
```

Then, do a global find and replace for uses of `sample-react-components-library` to `my-awesome-lib`.

Run `yarn` and you should be good to go! Don't forget to replace this README and the `ExampleComponent` supplied.
