# Sample React Components Library
Use this repo as the base for a new Festicket component library using React.

## Setup
First, you'll want to fork this repo into a new project. Then, do a global find and replace for uses of `sample-react-components-library` with the non-scoped name of your new repo. For example, if you are creating `@festicket/new-lib`, replace `sample-react-components-library` with `new-lib`.

Run `yarn` and you should be good to go! Don't forget to replace this README and the `ExampleComponent` supplied.
